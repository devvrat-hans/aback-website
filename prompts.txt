based on the website that we now have, modify the footer.html. Keep only those links in the footer which are important and necessary to be present in the website.
also if you want to detlete some unecessary pages form teh footer which were initially there, tehn you can.
The desing of the footer lookks good, no need to change that, only modify the content of hte footer

when i open the index.html page of the website it opens like this with this url https://aback.ai/index

update the .htaccess to make the url of the index.html page as aback.ai and nothing else
fix this thing
