firstly, i am making this calculator for the indian business. so make sure there is an option to get the calculator results in indian rupees also

for the wages and the rate converstions between usd and inr you can use the purchasing power parity of 5

we can use this api key for convertion rates between usd and inr

here is the api call:

const data = null;

const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.withCredentials = true;

xhr.addEventListener("readystatechange", function () {
if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {
console.log(this.responseText);
}
});

xhr.open("GET", "https://anyapi.io/api/v1/exchange/convert?base=USD&to=EUR&amount=10000&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY");

xhr.send(data);

format for the output:

{
"base": "USD",
"to": "EUR",
"amount": 10000,
"converted": 8763,
"rate": 0.8763,
"lastUpdate": 1749168000
