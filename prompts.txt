so we have pages and we have the index.html

modify the template.js to load the navbar, footer and the chatbot in the pages which include the about.html, blog.html, careers.html, contact.html, ethics-charter.html, privacy.html, terms.html, whyus.html, serivces.html

and for the index.html, we will have the templates directly copy pasted into the index.html file and the code will directly run from there

to best of my knowledge, teh hosted wesite is not loading templates because of some issue with the templates.js and .htaccess
the current strucsture of the url on the hosted website is not being followed on the website templates and is causing not loading of templates.

please fix this issue as the production environment currently doesn't have any navbar, chatbot or footer
